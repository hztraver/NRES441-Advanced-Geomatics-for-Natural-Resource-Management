# Mapping Forest Disturbance with Landsat Time series {#time-series}

Written by: Hana Travers-Smith

## Lab Overview {.unnumbered}

Landsat time series data is a valuable tool for mapping forest
disturbance history due to its consistent global coverage and long
temporal record, dating back to 1972. By analyzing a sequence of Landsat
images, forest disturbances such as logging, wildfires, insect
infestations, and storms can be detected and monitored over time.
Changes in vegetation reflectance captured in multispectral bands,
especially the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands,
are used to identify disturbances.

In this lab you will use a time series of Landsat images from 2000-2020
to map wild fire history for a forest located near Williams Lake BC.

### Data {.unnumbered}

-   Annual Landsat Best-Available-Pixel (BAP) Surface Reflectance
    Composites from 1984-2022

Best Available Pixel Composites are used to create high quality,
cloud-free images from multiple overlapping scenes of the same area.
Each pixel is assigned a score representing its quality based on how
cloudy or hazy it is, or what sensor it is from. Only the "best" pixels
with the highest scores are retained - so a single BAP composite has
only high-quality pixels from many different image acquisitions which
reduces the number of data gaps within an image.

For this lab, BAP composites were created for every year using Landsat
scenes acquired within the growing season (July-August). So the 1999 BAP
composite will only contain pixels from the 1999 growing season.

Annual BAP composites were then stacked in 5-year periods (i.e.
1990-1995) and the median value across the 5 scenes was calculated. This
step was taken to reduce differences in scene illumination and data
availability that can create artefacts within annual BAP composites.
Each raster in the lab contains the time period in the layer name.

The study area for this lab is a forested region just outside of
William's Lake, BC.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/02/03-series.png')
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Task 1: Import and build raster time series

**Step 1:** Open EVI \> File \> New \> Build Raster Series. Click Add
Raster \> Add Filename and navigate to the folder containing the .tif
files for this lab. Hold the "Shift" key down and select all the .tif
files \> Open.

In the Rasters panel look at the filenames and ensure that they are
listed in chronological order. Check "Order by Time". Name the output
"time_series" and save it to the same folder as the input rasters \> OK.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/02/03-timeseries.png')
```

Use the arrows on the "Series Manager" window to examine each image in
the time series. **Note that the acquisition date shows the first year
in the 5-year time period**. So if the date is July 2011 then the image
is actually the Best Available Composite of many images from 2011 to
2016.

If you close this window you can open it again using Display \>
Series/Animation Manager.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/02/03-seriesman.png')
```

**Step 2:** To visualize different band/color combinations select the
time series object in the Layer Manager and change the Band Combinations
using the sliders in the bottom right corner. Experiment with the
Shortwave infrared and Near-infrared color combinations.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/02/03-bands.png')
```

#### Q1) Describe three types of forest disturbance that are likely present in this time-series. 

**Step 3:** Right click on the raster series object in the Layer Manager
(it has a red box with the number 1) \> Profiles \> Series. The Series
Profile window will show the change in spectral values over time. You
can change the spectral band that is being plotted by clicking on the
"Source" button at the top of the window.

To change the format of the dates on the X-axis click on the sideways
arrow on the right-side of the window to expand it. In the "General" tab
click Date Format \> Mon YYYY. Although the month of acquisition should
be July for each image, ENVI may display other months. The year
indicates the first year in the 5-year time period. Note that percent
reflectance has been scaled by a factor of 10,000.

#### Q2) Show the change in NIR band for a disturbed a pixel. Upload a screenshot of the time series plot showing the cross hairs on the image and give the image a descriptive caption.

### Task 2: Calculate Normalized Burn Ratio using ENVI Modeler

In this task you will use the ENVI Modeler to build a processing
workflow and calculate the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) for each raster
in the time series.

ENVI Modeler is a visual interface that allows you to automate image
processing and analysis tasks using a graphical interface. Each step in
the workflow is represented by a **node** representing input layers and
data processing tools. By creating a Modeler workflow you can
automatically run the same processing steps across multiple rasters in a
row - without the need for coding expertise!

The key to this process is the **"Iterator"** node which takes a list of
rasters as the input and applies the same processing tasks to each
raster in the list.

**Step 1:** Display \> ENVI Modeler. On the left there are lists of node
types including inputs to the model and specfic tasks. We will create a
simple model to read in the time-series data, calculate the Normalized
Burn Ratio and write a new raster layer of the output.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/02/03-modeler.png')
```

**Step 2:** Click and drag the **File** node to the Layout window and
specify the type as "Raster Series". Navigate to the time series object
you created in the last task. You should now see a blue box in the
Layout window populated with the "time_series.series" object.

Add the following data processing steps into the model by searching for
them in the Basic Nodes and Tasks menus. Read the description for each
node by selecting it in the menu. Once all nodes are added to the Layout
window connect them using arrows (click on a node and draw a connection
to the next node.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/02/03-model.png')
```

**Step 3:** On the Spectral Index tool click on the three dashed lines
to open the tool parameters. Change the "Index" field to Normalized Burn
Ratio.

**Step 4:** We also need to set the parameters for the "Generate
Filename" node. This node will generate a unique output file name for
each raster in the time series so we don't overwrite outputs with the
same name!

Right-click on the connection between "Iterator" and "Generate Filename"
\> Edit Connection. Click on "Iteration Index" and then the "Number to
Append" to connect these two variables. This will send a unique index
number from the iterator to the file name generator - which will append
the index to the end of the file name.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/02/03-connect1.png')
```

Click on the dashed lines of the "Generate Filename" tool.

-   Choose a directory to save the NBR outputs to
-   Filename Prefix: NBR\_
-   Check No for "Append Random Number"
-   Extension: .dat

Right-click the connection between "Generate Filename" and "Spectral
Index" \> Edit Connection. Connect "Output Filename" and "Output Raster
URI". This will give the unique filename to the output raster.

When you are done click Run. After the model finishes running you should
see the NBR layers appear in the Layer Manager. The index values
appended to each layer run from 00 (first layer in the time-series) to
015 (last layer).

#### Q3) What is the equation for the Normalized Burn Ratio using Landsat 5 band designations?

#### Q4) A very low or negative value in NBR indicates a pixel with...

a)  Healthy and green vegetation\
b)  Recently burned or barren surfaces\
c)  A high severity fire\
d)  A low severity fire

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Task 3: Classify fire history over the landscape

**Step 1:** Make a raster stack from the Normalized Burn Ratio layers.
In the Toolbox search for "Build Layer Stack".

-   Input Rasters: All Normalized Burn Ratio rasters created in the last
    step (select multiple files by holding the shift key and clicking
    the first and last files)
-   Grid definition: select the "From Dataset" button and select any of
    the NBR rasters
-   Resampling Method: Nearest Neighbour
-   Output Raster: Save the output in your data folder as "NBR_stack"
-   Display Result: Checked

You should now see a new layer in the Layer Manager and on the map. The
default color combination is to assign the top three rasters in the
layer stack in the Red, Green and Blue channels. In this case you will
see the *most recent* three images in the time series visualized in this
way.

Next, we will rename the bands so it is easier to understand what is
happening. Right click on the "NBR_stack" in the Layer Manager \> View
Metadata \> Edit Metadata \> Display \> Click on the folder "Import from
ASCII" \> open the "band_names.txt" file. The bands in the Layer Manager
should now be labelled with their respective image years.

By looking at how NBR values change between images we can classify
disturbance history (i.e. if a pixel was disutrbed and when it happened)
across the study area.

#### Q5) The RGB color channels are designated to NBR images from the following three time periods R:"2013-2018", G:"2014-2019" and B:"2015-2020" (shown in image below). Check all true statements.

\- The red areas have high NBR values in the "2013-2018" image and low
NBR in the other two\
- The red areas have low NBR values in the "2013-2018" image and high
NBR in the other two\
- Red areas indicate a disturbance occurred between 2013 and 2020\
- Red areas indicate a disturbance has never occurred between 2013 and
2020\
- Bright pixels mean no disturbance has occurred, and vegetation is
unhealthy\
- Bright pixels mean no disturbance has occurred, and vegetation is
healthy\
- Black pixels mean that NBR is high in all images\
- Black pixels mean that NBR is low in all images\
- Black areas indicate that a disturbance occurred between 2013 and
2020\
- Black areas indicate that a disturbance occurred before 2013

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/02/03-nbrstack.png')
```

**Step 2:** Next we will classify the image using the NBR image stack
with an **IsoData Classification**. This is an unsupervised
classification that will classify pixels based on similarity in the NBR
values over time. We can use this classification to define different
disturbance histories across the landscape.

Search for "IsoData Classification" in the Toolbox.

-   Input Raster: NBR_stack
-   Number of Classes: 4
-   Output Raster: NBR_time_series_classification
-   leave all other settings as default

Examine the output classification raster. Right click on "Classes" in
the Layer Manager and select 'NBR-stack". The figure shows how the mean
NBR values change within each class. Use this figure and your
interpretation of the images to address the next question.

#### Q6) Label the four classes in the IsoData classification using the following disturbance histories: "Undisturbed and not forested", "Undisturbed healthy vegetation", "Highly disturbed forest", "Mild to moderate forest disturbance". Upload a screenshot of the output classification raster with the class legend visible.

#### Q7) Report the percent of the study area covered by the four classes and round to the nearest percent.
